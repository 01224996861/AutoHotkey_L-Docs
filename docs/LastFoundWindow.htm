<h1>The &quot;Last Found&quot; Window</h1>
<hr size="2">
<p>This is the window most recently found by <a href="commands/IfWinExist.htm">IfWin[Not]Exist</a>,  <a href="commands/IfWinActive.htm">IfWin[Not]Active</a>, <a href="commands/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWait[Not]Active</a>, or <a href="commands/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>. It can make scripts easier to create and maintain since the WinTitle and WinText of the target window do not need to be repeated for every windowing command. In addition, scripts perform better  because they don't need to search for the target window again after it has been found the first time.</p>
<p>The &quot;last found&quot; window can be used by all of the windowing commands except <a href="commands/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, <a href="commands/WinActivateBottom.htm">WinActivateBottom</a>, and <a href="commands/GroupAdd.htm">GroupAdd</a>. To use it, simply omit all four window parameters (WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, and ExcludeText).</p>
<p>Each <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> retains its own value of the &quot;last found&quot; window, meaning that if the <a href="misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is interrupted by another, when the original thread is resumed it will still have its original value of the &quot;last found&quot; window, not that of the interrupting thread.</p>
<p>If the last found window is a hidden <a href="commands/Gui.htm">Gui window</a>, it can be used even when <a href="commands/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is Off. This is often used in conjunction with &quot;<a href="commands/Gui.htm#LastFound">Gui +LastFound</a>&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<pre class="NoIndent">Run Notepad
WinWait Untitled - Notepad
WinActivate  <span class="CodeCom">; Uses the last found window.</span>

IfWinExist, Untitled - Notepad
{
    WinActivate  <span class="CodeCom">; Automatically uses the window found above.</span>
    WinMaximize  <span class="CodeCom">; same</span>
    Send, Some text.{Enter}
    return
}

IfWinNotExist, Calculator
    return
else
{
    WinActivate  <span class="CodeCom">; The above &quot;IfWinNotExist&quot; also set the &quot;last found&quot; window for us.</span>
    WinMove, 40, 40  <span class="CodeCom">; Move it to a new position.</span>
    return
}</pre>
<h2>Other Usages of the <em>WinTitle</em> Parameter</h2>
<p>If multiple windows match the WinTitle/Text criteria of a windowing command such as <a href="commands/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a>, the one that is above the others in stacking order is used. For example, if the active/foremost window matches the criteria, it is used even if there are other matching windows beneath it.</p>
<p><strong>Active Window (A)</strong>: Almost all of the windowing commands can be told to operate upon the active window by specifying the letter A as the WinTitle parameter and omitting WinText, ExcludeTitle, and ExcludeText. In the following example, Win+UpArrow becomes a hotkey to maximize the active window: <em>#Up::WinMaximize A</em></p>
<p><strong><a name="class"></a>Window Class (ahk_class)</strong>: All windowing commands can operate upon a class of windows by the class text shown by Window Spy or retrieved by <a href="commands/WinGetClass.htm">WinGetClass</a>. In the following example, a split-view Explorer window would be activated: <em>WinActivate ahk_class ExploreWClass</em></p>
<p><strong><a name="id"></a>Unique ID/HWND (ahk_id)</strong>: All windowing commands can operate upon a specific window or control via its unique ID number. For example: <em>WinActivate ahk_id %VarContainingID%</em>. The ID of a window is typically retrieved via <a href="commands/IfWinExist.htm">WinExist()</a> or <a href="commands/WinGet.htm">WinGet</a>.  The ID of a control is typically retrieved via <a href="commands/ControlGet.htm#Hwnd">ControlGet Hwnd</a>, <a href="commands/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a>, or <a href="commands/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>. Also, ahk_id will operate upon controls even if they are hidden; that is, the setting of <a href="commands/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> does not matter.</p>
<p><strong><a name="pid"></a>Process ID (ahk_pid)</strong>: All windowing commands can operate upon the window(s) belonging a process identifier (PID). For example, <em>WinClose ahk_pid %VarContainingPID%</em> would close the topmost window of that process. A PID can be retrieved via <a href="commands/WinGet.htm">WinGet</a> or <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="commands/Process.htm">Process</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="group"></a>Window Group (ahk_group)</strong>: All windowing commands can operate upon the windows belonging to a <a href="commands/GroupAdd.htm">window group</a> by specifying <em>ahk_group MyGroupName</em> for the <em>WinTitle</em> parameter. The commands <a href="commands/WinMinimize.htm">WinMinimize</a>, <a href="commands/WinMaximize.htm">WinMaximize</a>, <a href="commands/WinRestore.htm">WinRestore</a>, <a href="commands/WinHide.htm">WinHide</a>, <a href="commands/WinShow.htm">WinShow</a>, <a href="commands/WinClose.htm">WinClose</a>, and <a href="commands/WinKill.htm">WinKill</a> will act upon <strong>all</strong> the group's windows. By contrast, the other window commands such as <a href="commands/WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a> and <a href="commands/IfWinExist.htm">IfWinExist</a> will operate only upon the topmost window of the group.</p>
<p><a name="multi"></a><strong>Multiple Criteria</strong>: By contrast with ahk_group in the paragraph above (which broadens the search), the search may be narrowed by specifying more than one criterion within the WinTitle parameter. In the following example, the script waits for a window whose title contains <em>My File.txt</em> <strong>and</strong> whose class is <em>Notepad</em>:</p>
<pre>WinWait <strong>My File.txt</strong> ahk_class <strong>Notepad</strong>
WinActivate  <span class="CodeCom">; Activate the window it found.</span></pre>
<p>When using this method, the text of the title (if any is desired) should be listed first, followed by one or more additional criteria. Criteria beyond the first should be separated from the previous with exactly one space or tab (any other spaces or tabs are treated as a literal part of the previous criterion).</p>
