<h1>DriveUnlock</h1>

<p>Restores the eject feature of the specified drive.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">DriveUnlock</span> Drive</pre>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Drive</dt>
    <dd>The drive letter followed by a colon and an optional backslash (might also work on UNC paths and mapped drives).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>This function returns 1 (true) to indicate success or 0 (false) to indicate failure.</p>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem or 0 otherwise.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>This function needs to be called multiple times if the drive was locked multiple times (at least for some drives). For example, if <code>DriveLock("D:")</code> was called three times, <code>DriveUnlock("D:")</code> might need to be called three times to unlock it. Because of this and the fact that there is no way to determine whether a drive is currently locked, it is often useful to keep track of its lock-state in a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a>.</p>
