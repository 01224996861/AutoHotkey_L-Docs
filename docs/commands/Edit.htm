<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>Opens the current script for editing in the associated editor.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Edit</pre>
<p>The Edit command opens the current script for editing using the associated &quot;edit&quot; verb in the registry (or Notepad if no verb). However, if an editor window appears to have the script already open (based on its window title), that window is activated instead of opening a new instance of the editor.</p>
<p>The Edit command  is equivalent to selecting &quot;Edit This Script&quot; from the tray icon menu.</p>
<p>This command  has no effect when operating from within a compiled script.</p>
<p>On a related note, the Extras folder included with AutoHotkey has some add-ons for editors such as TextPad. In addition, context sensitive help for AutoHotkey commands can be enabled in any editor via <a href="../scripts/ContextSensitiveHelp.htm">this example</a>. Finally, your productivity may be improved by using an auto-completion utility like 


 <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic12985.html">ISense</a>, which works in almost any editor. It watches what you type and displays menus and parameter lists, which does some of the typing for you and reminds you of the order of parameters.</p>
