<h1>SetWorkingDir</h1>
<hr size="2">
<p>Changes the script's current working directory. </p>

<p class="CommandSyntax">SetWorkingDir, DirName</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%">DirName</td>
    <td width="85%">The name of the new working directory, which is assumed to be a subfolder of the current <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>ErrorLevel</h4>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem or 0 otherwise.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>The script's working directory is the default directory that is used to access files and folders when an absolute path has not been specified. In the following example, the file <em> My Filename.txt</em> is assumed to be in %A_WorkingDir%: <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>, A Line of Text, My Filename.txt</p>
<p>A script's initial working directory is determined by how it was launched. For example, if it was run via shortcut -- such as on the Start Menu -- its working directory is determined by the &quot;Start in&quot; field within the shortcut's properties.</p>
<p>To make a script unconditionally use its own folder as its working directory, make its first line the following:<br>
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%</p>
<p>Once changed, the new working directory is instantly and globally in effect throughout the script. All interrupted, <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>, and newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> are affected, including <a href="SetTimer.htm">Timers</a>.</p>
