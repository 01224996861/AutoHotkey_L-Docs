<h1>#MaxThreadsBuffer</h1>
<hr size="2">
<p>Causes some or all <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> to buffer rather than ignore keypresses when their <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> limit has been reached. </p>

<p class="CommandSyntax">#MaxThreadsBuffer On|Off</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%">On|Off</td>
    <td width="85%"><p>On: All hotkey subroutines between here and the next <em>#MaxThreadsBuffer ON</em> directive will buffer rather than ignore presses of their hotkeys whenever their subroutines are at their <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> limit.</p>
    <p>Off: This is the default behavior. A hotkey press will be ignored whenever that hotkey is already running its maximum number of threads (usually 1, but this can be changed with <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a>).</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>This directive is rarely used because this type of buffering, which is OFF by default, usually does more harm than good. For example, if you accidentally press a hotkey twice, having this setting ON would cause that hotkey's subroutine to automatically run a second time if its first <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> takes less than 1 second to finish (this type of buffer expires after 1 second, by design). Note that AutoHotkey  buffers hotkeys in several other ways (such as &quot;<a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a>&quot; and <a href="Critical.htm">&quot;Critical&quot;</a>). It's just that this particular way can be detrimental, thus it is OFF by default.</p>
<p>The main use for this directive is to increase the responsiveness of the keyboard's auto-repeat feature. For example, when you hold down a hotkey whose <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> setting is 1 (the default), incoming keypresses  are ignored if that hotkey subroutine is already running. Thus, when the subroutine finishes, it must wait for the next auto-repeat keypress to come in, which might take 50ms or more due to being caught in between keystrokes of the auto-repeat cycle. This 50ms delay can be avoided by enabling this directive for any hotkey that needs the best possible response time while it is being auto-repeated.</p>
<p>As with all # directives, this one should not be positioned in the script as though it were a command (i.e. it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey label you wish to have affected by it.</p>
