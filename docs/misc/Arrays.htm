<h1>Arrays</h1>
<hr size="2">
<p>In AutoHotkey, arrays are mostly conceptual: Each array is really just a collection of sequentially numbered <a href="../Variables.htm">variables</a> or <a href="../Functions.htm">functions</a>, each one being perceived as an <em>element</em> of the array. AutoHotkey does not link these elements together in any way.</p>
<p>In addition to array-creating commands like <a href="../commands/StringSplit.htm">StringSplit</a> and &quot;<a href="../commands/WinGet.htm">WinGet List</a>&quot;, any command that accepts an OutputVar or that assigns a value to a variable can be used to create an array. The simplest example is the <a href="../commands/SetExpression.htm">assignment operator (:=)</a>, as shown below:</p>
<pre>Array%j% := A_LoopField</pre>
<p>Multidimensional arrays are possible by using a separator character of your choice between the indices. For example:</p>
<pre>Array%j%_%k% := A_LoopReadLine</pre>
<p><br> 
  The following example demonstrates how to create and access an array, in this case a series of names retrieved from a text file:</p>
<pre><span class="CodeCom"><strong>; Write to the array:</strong></span>
ArrayCount = 0
Loop, Read, C:\Guest List.txt   <span class="CodeCom">; This loop retrieves each line from the file, one at a time.</span>
{
    ArrayCount += 1  <span class="CodeCom">; Keep track of how many items are in the array.</span>
    Array%ArrayCount% := A_LoopReadLine  <span class="CodeCom">; Store this line in the next array element.</span>
}

<span class="CodeCom"><strong>; Read from the array:</strong></span>
Loop %ArrayCount%
{
    <span class="CodeCom">; The following line uses the := operator to retrieve an array element:</span>
    element := Array%A_Index%  <span class="CodeCom">; <a href="../Variables.htm#Index">A_Index</a> is a built-in variable.</span>
    <span class="CodeCom">; Alternatively, you could use the &quot;% &quot; prefix to make MsgBox or some other command <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression-capable</a>:</span>
    MsgBox % &quot;Element number &quot; . A_Index . &quot; is &quot; . Array%A_Index%
}</pre>
<p>A concept related to arrays is the use of <a href="../Functions.htm#NumPut">NumPut()</a> and <a href="../Functions.htm#NumGet">NumGet()</a> to store/retrieve a collection of numbers in binary format. This might be helpful in cases where performance and/or memory conservation are important.</p>
<h2>Associative Arrays and Hashing via &quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot; is an operating system feature that has more capabilities and flexibility than AutoHotkey's pseudo-arrays. Its use is demonstrated at <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic17838.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic17838.html</a>.</p>
