<h1>ErrorLevel</h1>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> ErrorLevel is being phased out for AutoHotkey v2.0.</p>
<p>This is a built-in variable that is set to indicate the success or failure of some of the built-in functions (not all built-in functions change the value of ErrorLevel). A value of 0 usually indicates success, and any other value usually indicates failure. You can also set the value of ErrorLevel yourself.</p>
<p>Each <a href="Threads.htm">thread</a> starts with an ErrorLevel of 0 and retains its own value of ErrorLevel, meaning that if the <a href="Threads.htm">current thread</a> is interrupted by another, when the original thread is resumed it will still have its original value of ErrorLevel, not the ErrorLevel that may have been set by the interrupting thread.</p>
<p>Although ErrorLevel typically contains a number (most often 0 or 1), the script can assign other types of values to it.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Since some built-in functions set ErrorLevel to values higher than 1, it is best not check whether ErrorLevel is 1, but instead whether ErrorLevel is not zero.</p>
<p>The following list contains all functions which set ErrorLevel, including the possible ErrorLevel values:</p>
<table class="info">
    <tr><td><a href="../commands/Input.htm">Input</a></td><td>NewInput, Max, Timeout, Match, EndKey:Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="../commands/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a></td><td>0, 1, 2</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="../commands/Sort.htm#unique">Sort: U option</a></td><td>0, <em>n</em></td></tr>
</table>
